# README

This calendar was built to solve the following coding challenge:

#### Create an App using Rails&Postgres that renders a calendar and allows you to add an event

* Calendar should allow you to move forward and backward months
* Calendar can have an event added to a day (event should have a name and time)
* Events should be able to be removed or rescheduled
* There can only be 1 event at a specific time on any given day
* The calendar doesn't have to look nice or be styled, it just has to look like a calendar


Important:
* Don't use any frameworks that create calendars for you, the rest is up you on the frontend
* Calendar must be rendered using no gems that do the rendering for you
* The begginning of the week should be a Sunday
* Create a repo on Github

BONUS:
* Use Slim framework instead of ERB for the frontend
* If you decide to use Rails 5 make the events update in realtime for different viewers of the calendar
